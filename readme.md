## More Details

### What do we use to make graphql requests?

To make the requests we use [apollo-client](https://www.apollographql.com/) which allows us to work with graphql in a simple and fast way.

### Why we use GraphQL Code Generator?

In order to have all the types that we have in our api we use [graphql-code-generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com) since this way we can obtain the typeScript typing of each of our entities which saves us the time of not defining the types ourselves.

### Why do we use J-MarkEditor to write this readme?

To write this readme.md we use [J-MarkEditor](https://jmarkeditor.jordanjaramillo.co) because it allows you to get a real-time display of your markdown syntax and also has a friendly editor for any developer.
